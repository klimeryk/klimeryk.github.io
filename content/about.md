Programming since I can remember. Iâ€™ve dabbled both in high(ish)-level languages and libraries (Java, GWT, , PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript) and low(ish)-level (mainly C++). Apart from strong programming skills, I have vast knowledge (and experience!) with administration of Linux boxes (Gentoo FTW). When push comes to shove I can even spit out some `SQL SELECT`s or create an efficient view in CouchDB.

Interested in working with me? Want to see a full-fledged CV? Contact me at whatever-you-want-address (funny and/or creative addresses will get priority ðŸ™ƒ) `@cv.klimer.eu`.
