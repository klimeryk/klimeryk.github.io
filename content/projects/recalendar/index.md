#### Highly customizable calendar for ReMarkable and other e-ink tablets.

ReCalendar allows you to generate your own, personalized calendar right in your browser.

[Visit project](https://recalendar.me/)

[Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar.js)

*   Optimized for the [ReMarkable 2 tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) (should work with version 1 as well) to use the full space available and minimize screen refreshes.
*   No hacks needed - the generated PDF is a normal file, with links, etc. that you can simply upload normally to your tablet.
*   Heavy use of links to allow quick and easy navigation.
*   Lots of easy configuration options to tailor the calendar to your needs - plus access to the source code for even more advanced customization.
*   Easily switch to any locale supported by PHP.
*   Add extra pages to all or selected days of the week to suit your needs.
*   Provide a list of special dates (anniversaries, birthdays, etc.) and let ReCalendar embed them into your personalized calendar - on monthly views, weekly overviews and finally, day entries.
*   Track your habits monthly.
*   Start the "year" on arbitrary month (can be useful for tracking academic years, etc.).
