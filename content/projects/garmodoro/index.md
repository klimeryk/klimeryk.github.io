*   A lightweight and clean implementation of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
*   Keeps track of time left in your Pomodoro session, as well as break time and overal number of Pomodoros.
*   **Mimics the ticking of a real physical Pomodoro** by using short vibrations.
*   Alerts you using vibrations and tones.
*   **Supports all Garmin devices** using Connect IQ.
*   You can customize many aspects of the technique:
    *   length of one Pomodoro (default: 25 minutes)
    *   length of the short break between Pomodoros (default: 5 minutes)
    *   length of the long break between groups of Pomodoros (default: 30 minutes)
    *   the number of Pomodoros in a group (default: 4)
    *   the strength and duration of the vibration "tick" (set either to `0` to disable)
